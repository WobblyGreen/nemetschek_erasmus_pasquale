## Description
This repo contains all the tasks that I did during erasmus+ project at Nemetschek in Sofia, Bulgaria.<br>
Almost all of the tasks are leetcode-like problems.<br>
Among all of the tasks there is a remarkable one which simulates a natural environment. [NaturalReserveSimulation](https://github.com/WobblyGreen/nemetschek_erasmus_pasquale/tree/NatureReserveSimulation)
